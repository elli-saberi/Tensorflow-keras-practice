# Deep Learning Practice with TensorFlow & Keras



This repository serves as a personal practice ground for the concepts and techniques covered in the "Comprehensive Deep Learning Course with TensorFlow and Keras". It documents my learning journey, containing all the exercises, mini-projects, and code implementations from the course.

The primary goal is to build a strong, hands-on foundation in Deep Learning, from fundamental neural networks to advanced architectures like CNNs and RNNs.
